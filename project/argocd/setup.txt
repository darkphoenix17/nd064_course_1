Here are some noteworthy steps to install and setup ArgoCD:

    Use the official ArgoCD install page
    The YAML manifest for the NodePort service can be found under the argocd-server-nodeport.yaml file in the course repository. Link: https://github.com/udacity/nd064_course_1/blob/main/solutions/argocd/argocd-server-nodeport.yaml
    Access the ArgoCD UI by going to https://192.168.50.4:30008 or http://192.168.50.4:30007 Note: You can find the IP in the Vagrantfile. 
    When accessing the ArgoCD UI, a browser SSL warning is encountered. This is happening because the ArgoCD server is not setup with SSL certificates to authenticate the server. Hence, an insecure connection is established with the server. As a result, the warning prompt is encountered and you should just bypass the warning page
    Login credentials can be retrieved using the steps in the credentials guide. Link: https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/getting_started/#4-login-using-the-cli
